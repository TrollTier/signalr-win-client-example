# signalr-win-client-example
This is the accompanying WPF client for the signalr-api-example repository.

You can use multiple instances of this client to exchange messages.
Currently it only works on your local machine, is ugly, does NOT use MVVM or similar and is only meant to be 
a focused demonstration of websockets with signalr.
